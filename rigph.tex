\section{pH Control loop}
\subsection{Overview}
pH control is a notoriously difficult control problem not only due to its highly non-linear nature and large temperature dependence but also due to the extreme conditions experienced by measuring equipment. These problems can be investigated on the rig shown in figure~\ref{fig:rig:ph}.

Three temperature measurements are made to provide the possibility for temperature compensation.
