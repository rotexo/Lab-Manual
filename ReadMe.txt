This as far as I understand it is to be the repository for the Process Modelling and Control groups manuals. 

A few rules I suppose would be a good start. 

1) Read the etiquiette section in svn_for_Windows\svn_for_Windows.pdfto see how to post update messages. No matter how small the update. This just keeps everyone in the loop as to what's happening.
2) If you need any particular manual to be loaded e-mail me carelvdam@gmail.com if you need it urgently 084 807 0876.
3) Dont' upload useless files that get generated during the course of running some program e.g. for any tex documentation don't upload any *.AUX or *.toc files. People can generate these by themselves when compiling the documentation. 

To Do (objectives): 

- Neaten up SVN_for_windows document.
- Commit the various lab manuals in an intelligent manner.
- Create a PM&C group style file.
- Update the lab manual itself.
- Find out how to provide otherwith access to the repo.

To my knowledge the commit logs actually will be the best method for following/suggesting changes I will try to maintian a to do list in this document however. The alternative is to include a to do list in the main tex file of each document and try to steer the collection of documents via this readme.
