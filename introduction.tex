\chapter{Introduction}
The document gives an overview of the different components associated with the implementation of a data acquisition and control system, to enable the control of the experimental setups with the use of the computer. This was achieved through the centralised implementation of an analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) conversion instrumentation called the OPTO22 SNAP I/O range.

Certain protocols or methods were accordingly defined to standardise the implementation of the physical wiring and the software used, and this document discusses these methods. Some practical issues surrounding the implementation an control system on an experimental setup is also discussed. 

The document is divided into the following chapters:
\begin{description}
	\item [Chapter 2] gives an overview of the different issues surrounding the measurement and control of a ``real'' process.
	\item [Chapter 3] discusses the different software components, and their interaction, used in the acquisition of the data and the control of the different experimental setups.
	\item [Chapter 4] defines the protocols and methods used for the analog wiring of the instrumentation.
	\item [Chapter 5] discuss the different documentation types used in documenting the data acquisition and control system as well as the data base that was developed to store the relevant information.
